**Simplest form of SQLI.**

SQL injection (SQLi) is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to interfere with the queries that an application makes to its database.

- Launch the instance and open the website.

- If we enter a random username and password we will get the following response:

- We can right click the website and hit inspect element to see the source code of the website. We can see that we have a file called login.php (A PHP file is a webpage that contains PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) code. It may include PHP functions that can process online forms, get the date and time, or access information from a database, such as a MySQL database)

So, our username and password are being checked through a database. We can understand this also from the response statement we get. 

- Since, there is almost always a user in the database with the username: "admin" we will try to do an SQLI attack using the "admin" username.

Username: admin
Password: 'OR '1'='1

This combination will cause the sql query to take the following syntax: SELECT * FROM users WHERE name='admin' AND password=''OR '1'='1'

We know that name='admin' exists and that '1'='1' is a TRUE condition. So the database verifies that our inputs were correct and we get the following response:

- By clicking inspect element you will be able to see the flag in the source code.
