# Who are you?
**A http header field modification Web Exploitation challenge.**

- First, we click the website and see the following response: "Only people who use the official PicoBrowser are allowed on this site!". So the server does not accept our browser. There is a way to modify your browser information to whatever you want and then send a new request to the server with the altered browser.

- Open burpsuite and enable "Intercept". (Assuming you have configured burpsuite with your browser through the proxy settings)

- Whenever we request the website we can see the header fields and their values. For the header field: "User-Agent" we know that it specifies the browser that we use to make the request. So we can delete the value of this field and replace it with "Picobrowser", so we get the line "User-Agent: Picobrowser".

To find an analytical documentation about all of the http header fields and their meaning, visit:

or

https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2616#page-145

- After forwarding our modified request, we get the following response: "I don't trust users visiting from another site." There is an http header that specifies the website that the user was at the time that the redirection happened. So, we add the line "Referer: http://mercury.picoctf.net:34588/" which means that the referer of the website is the website itself.

- After forwarding our modified request, we get the following response: "Sorry, this site only worked in 2018." We can modify the date of our request to 2018 by adding the line "Date: 2018".

- After forwarding our modified request, we get the following response: "I don't trust users who can be tracked." We can modify the tracking status of our request by adding the line "DNT: 1". This means that Do Not Track is enabled.

- After forwarding our modified request, we get the following response: "This website is only for people from Sweden" We can modify the IP address of our request's origin by adding the line "X-Forwarded-For: 103.57.72.0". (We searched the web to find this random swedish IP address)


- After forwarding our modified request, we get the following response: "You're in Sweden but you don't speak Swedish?" We can modify the language of our request by changing the value of the "Accept-Language" header. We can add the line "Accept-Language: sv". By typing "sv" we mean the Swedish language. More info about the languages in the links mentioned above.

After forwarding, we can see the flag in the response document.

Here is the final request:

```bash
