The methodologies used in the challenge include SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), remote code execution (RCE), and other web application vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities can be exploited using tools such as Burp Suite, SQLmap, and various scripting languages.

To attack others using the knowledge gained from the Web Gauntlet challenge, adversaries could use a variety of methods, including:

- Scanning: Adversaries could scan for web applications that are vulnerable to the same types of attacks demonstrated in the challenge, using tools such as Nmap and ZAP.
- Exploiting: Once vulnerable web applications have been identified, adversaries could attempt to exploit them using the same techniques demonstrated in the challenge, such as SQL injection or XSS.
- Escalating privileges: Adversaries could attempt to escalate their privileges within the compromised web application, potentially gaining access to sensitive data or administrative functions.
- Maintaining persistence: Finally, adversaries could attempt to maintain persistence within the compromised web application, ensuring that they can continue to access it even if the initial vulnerability is patched or the application is upgraded. This could involve installing backdoors or other forms of malware, or compromising other parts of the target network.

In summary, the Web Gauntlet challenge provides a valuable learning experience for organizations and individuals looking to improve their web application security skills. However, it also highlights the importance of robust security controls and vigilant monitoring, as adversaries can use similar techniques to attack real-world web applications and compromise sensitive data.
