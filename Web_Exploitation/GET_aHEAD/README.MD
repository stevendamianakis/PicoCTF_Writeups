# GET aHEAD
**A http request method modification Web Exploitation challenge.**

- First, you need to download an integrated platform and graphical tool for performing security testing of web applications. Burpsuite, is a great tool for this purpose. 

- After you download Burpsuite, open a temporary new project and go to Proxy > Options and check the IP and port number of the proxy listeners. (example 127.0.0.1:8080)

- Open your browser and go to proxy settings and configure the proxy settings with the IP address and port number that you found in the proxy listeners in burpsuite.

- From the same browser, open the website http://burpsuite and download the burpsuite certificate from the right upper corner.

- Rename the file so that it has .cer extension.

- Add the certificate to the certificates of your browser.

- Now by clicking  Proxy > Intercept > Intercept is off, you should be able to see the traffic coming through burpsuite, whenever you make a request.

- Go to Proxy > Options and click the "Intercept responses based on the following rules" box under the "Intercept Server Responses" category. This will ensure that we will be able to see the responses of the requests that we forward, in burpsuite.

- Now open the link of the website of the challenge. We see that the challenge is named GET aHEAD. This already means that we will have to play with the HTTP request methods. We know from basic networking theory, that there are many different http request methods. More info about http request methods: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods

- Now, if we change the http request method from GET -> HEAD and forward the request, we will get the response that will contain the flag.
