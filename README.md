# PicoCTF Writeups

**A variety of PicoCTF writeups.**

PicoCTF is a free computer security education program with original content built on a capture-the-flag(CTF) framework created by security and privacy experts at Carnegie Mellon University. Participants must reverse engineer, break, hack, decrypt, and think creatively and critically to solve the challenges and capture the flags. More info: https://picoctf.org/

**Warning:** The writeups are for educational purposes.

**Requirements:** Just a Linux OS. (You can use Windows or MacOS, but they will make the process harder)
